## 🚀 About This Repository

High Performance Computing (HPC) is used to perform Complex Calculations, Train ML models, Research, If you are crazy enough probably you can mine bitcoin by solving cryptographic puzzles(Don't do it it's not worth). 
This repository serves as a **structured guide** for learning HPC concepts along with practical examples.

The content here is based on:

* Hands-on HPC cluster usage
* Online courses and tutorials
* Official documentation
* Personal experimentation
