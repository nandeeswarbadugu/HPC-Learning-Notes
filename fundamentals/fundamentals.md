## 📌 What is High Performance Computing (HPC)?

High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of powerful computing systems and parallel processing techniques to solve complex computational problems at high speed. Instead of relying on a single computer, HPC systems use clusters of interconnected computers (called nodes) working together as a single system.

These systems leverage:

* **Parallel processing** – dividing tasks across multiple processors
* **Distributed computing** – using multiple machines
* **High-speed networking** – enabling fast communication between nodes
* **Massive storage systems** – handling large datasets efficiently

### 🧠 Key Components of HPC Systems

1. **Compute Nodes**

   * Individual machines with CPUs/GPUs
   * Perform actual computation

2. **Interconnect Network**

   * High-speed communication (InfiniBand, Ethernet)
   * Transfers data between nodes

3. **Storage Systems**

   * Parallel file systems (Lustre, GPFS)
   * Designed for high throughput

4. **Job Scheduler**

   * Allocates resources (SLURM, PBS)
   * Manages job execution

5. **Accelerators**

   * GPUs, TPUs
   * Speed up specific computations
